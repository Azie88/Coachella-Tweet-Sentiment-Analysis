This project is about Natural Language Processing, specifically text classification (Sentiment analysis). In this project, we will fine tune a RoBERTa base sentiment analysis model on tweets about the Coachella 2015 music festival lineup to create a model that can predict of the sentiment expressed in a tweet (e.g: neutral, positive, negative), then create gradio app to use the models and deploy the app on HuggingFace spaces. This project will use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to leverage the GPU computational power.
